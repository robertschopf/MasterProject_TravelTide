# ‚úàÔ∏è **TravelTide: Personalized Rewards Program for Enhanced Customer Retention**

## üìÑ Context
TravelTide is an e-booking startup that has experienced growth since its founding in April 2021, driven by its data aggregation and search technology. While TravelTide provides customers access to a wide range of travel options, there's a need to improve customer retention by enhancing the customer experience. Elena Tarrant, Head of Marketing, aims to address this by developing a personalized rewards program.

## üéØ Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze customer data to understand customer preferences and develop a personalized rewards program. This program aims to incentivize repeat customer engagement with the TravelTide platform.

---

## üöÄ Approach and Implementation
The approach involved analyzing customer data to identify customer segments and their preferences for proposed perks. This analysis led to developing a model for assigning relevant perks to individual customers.

## üìä Project Steps

**Step 1: Data Exploration and Preparation**
* Customer data was examined, cleaned, and prepared.
* This included handling missing values, inconsistencies, and data transformation.
* Data included:
    * Demographics (age, gender, location, family status)
    * Booking histories (flights, hotels, packages)
    * Past discount/offer utilization
    * Website interaction data (clicks, searches)
    * Customer feedback/surveys (if available)

**Step 2: Customer Segmentation**
* The customer base was segmented to identify clusters with similar preferences and behaviors.
* Segmentation criteria included:
    * Demographics
    * Booking patterns (frequency, destinations, trip duration, lead time)
    * Customer lifetime value
    * Responsiveness to marketing campaigns

**Step 3: Analysis of Perk Preferences**
* Analysis determined the appeal of proposed perks to different customer segments.
* Proposed perks:
    * Free hotel meal
    * Free checked bag
    * No cancellation fees
    * Exclusive discounts
    * 1 night free hotel with flight booking
* Methods included:
    * Analysis of past benefit utilization
    * Correlation analysis (behavior vs. perk preferences)
    * Demographic insights
    * Discount utilization analysis
    * Cancellation behavior analysis

**Step 4: Development of a Perk Assignment Model**
* A model assigns each customer to their most relevant perk.
* Model techniques:
    * Rule-based systems
    * Decision trees
    * Machine learning algorithms
* Goal: Maximize the likelihood of perk appeal and program enrollment.

**Step 5: Validation of Results**
* Analysis results were validated for accuracy and reliability.
* Validation may involve statistical testing, cross-validation, or external data comparison.

## üîç Insights
* A segment with high price sensitivity and occasional bookings shows a strong affinity for flight discounts.
* Customers with high hotel booking frequency and loyalty value hotel perks (upgrades, late check-out, free meals).
* Segments with higher cancellation risk (families, short-notice bookers) value flexible cancellation policies.
* Demographics (family size, long-haul flights) correlate with interest in free checked baggage.
* Customers booking flight/hotel packages respond well to combined offers (e.g., free hotel night).

---

## üîÆ Future Work
* Post-implementation, an analysis of perk usage and impact on metrics like customer satisfaction and retention is essential.
* Customer segmentation must be regularly reviewed and adapted to address evolving customer needs and market trends.
* Future analyses should incorporate more data sources to obtain a more comprehensive customer view.

---

## üåü Standout Section
* This project focused on developing a data-driven approach to personalize a rewards program.
* The analysis provides insights into customer preferences to target customers with appealing perks.
* The project includes validation and continuous optimization for program effectiveness.

---

## üìã Executive Summary
* The analysis of customer data supports the development of a personalized rewards program for TravelTide.
* Customer segments show different preferences for rewards.
* A perk assignment model can match customers with suitable perks.
* Testing and optimization are important for the program's success.
