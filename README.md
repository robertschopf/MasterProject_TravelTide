### ‚úàÔ∏è TravelTide: Personalized Rewards Program for Enhanced Customer Retention

**üìÑ Context**

TravelTide is a dynamic e-booking startup making waves in the online travel industry. Since its inception in April 2021, TravelTide has achieved consistent growth, driven by its cutting-edge data aggregation and search technology. While TravelTide excels in providing customers with access to an extensive travel inventory, there's recognition that certain aspects of the customer experience require enhancement, particularly concerning customer retention. Elena Tarrant, the newly appointed Head of Marketing, is spearheading efforts to address this by developing a personalized rewards program. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

**üéØ Objective**

The primary objective of this project was to analyze customer data to gain insights into customer preferences and develop a personalized rewards program. This program aims to increase customer retention and foster stronger customer engagement with the TravelTide platform by delivering tailored incentives. [cite: 6, 8]

**üöÄ Approach and Implementation**

The approach involved a comprehensive analysis of customer data to understand customer behavior and perk preferences. This analysis led to the development of a model for assigning relevant perks to individual customers, thereby maximizing the appeal and effectiveness of the rewards program. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
